										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>My name is Mohamed Abdulkadir and I am currently a first year Data Analytics major specializing in Computational Analytics at The Ohio State University. 
											Growing up, I've always pondered on the idea of how technology can be made to make people's lives much easier and 
											also having a keen interest in how data can be used to solve complex problems.
											Ultimately, leading to my decision in becoming a data scientist because the idea of using programming to develop alogoritms and being able
											to make data-driven decisions from that is what intrigues me most. </p> </div>

										<h2 class="major">Organizations I'm involved In</h2>
										<p>I am currently a member of the following organizations: Alpha Lambda Delta Honor Society, Big Data & Analytics Association, and the OSU Sports Analytics Association. 
											As a member of the Big Data & Analytics Association, this organization aims to inspire members like me to think analytically and empower us through
											hands-on training. With the Sports Analytics Association, we attend weekly meetings that consist of data workshops, analytics-related 
											presentations, and more to foster the interest of applying analytical methods to sports or to widen the scope of sports analysis. Which interests me a great deal.

									<h2 class="major">Interests</h2> 
										<p>In my free time, when I'm not doing projects or certifications, I enjoy playing and watching basketball. 
											I've always loved the fast-paced/intensity of the game and how it shows you must possess strategy and teamwork to be successful. My favorite team is the Toronto Raptors because of their exciting style of play and Canada also being a second home to me. 
											I hope to do a project sometime in the near future where I explore data for the Toronto Raptors and use it to make machine learning models and visualizations. </p>

											<h3 class="major">COVID-19 Data Exploration</h3>
											<p>Tools used in this project were Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I first cleaned the data in excel and transferred the data to SQL. After, I explored the data in SQL by comparing the deaths/vaccinations that have happened since the start of 2020 until the end and closely focusing on that. Created views then transferred the data to Tableau to visualize our findings. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Airbnb Data Visualization</h3>
											<p>Tools used in this project were Excel and Tableau.

											 In this project, I used Excel to clean and manipulate the Airbnb data (removing duplicates, blank spaces, and more), using formulas and functions to calculate averages, filtering/sorting data, etc. I then imported this data into Tableau, where I created an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to explore the data in greater depth.
